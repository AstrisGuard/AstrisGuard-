# 🌠 AstrisGuard: Multi-Layer Blockchain Protection

**AstrisGuard** delivers layered AI-powered protection for blockchain activity — ensuring transaction integrity, risk visibility, and real-time behavioral analysis across decentralized markets.

## 🔑 Key Features

### 🛡 StarGuard  
Detects high-risk tokens by evaluating sudden price changes and liquidity weakness. Flags potential rug pulls and volatility-based threats.

### 🛰 OrbitalTrack  
Scans for abnormal transaction patterns, including bot activity, wash trading, and spoofing — keeping chain behavior clean and accountable.

### 🧠 CosmosGuard  
Performs contract intelligence analysis, flagging complex or suspicious code structures that may lead to vulnerabilities or exploits.

### ☄️ MeteorShield  
Tracks token velocity and large-scale fund movements, spotting flash dumps, liquidity drains, and whale activity spikes.

### ⏱ CelestialSync  
Validates blockchain timestamps against real-world time. Flags delayed or manipulated transactions that could signal foul play.

## 🧠 AI Modules

AstrisGuard is powered by a coordinated system of AI modules designed to detect volatility, contract complexity, time drift, and blockchain manipulation in real time.

### 🛡 StarGuard — Volatility & Liquidity Risk Analyzer  
**Language:** Python

```python
def star_guard(transaction_data):
    risk_threshold = 0.5
    price_deviation = abs(transaction_data["current_price"] - transaction_data["previous_price"]) / transaction_data["previous_price"]
    liquidity_ratio = transaction_data["token_volume"] / transaction_data["market_liquidity"]

    risk_score = price_deviation * liquidity_ratio

    if risk_score > risk_threshold:
        return "⚠️ Alert: High Token Risk Detected"
    return "✅ Token Appears Safe"
```
#### Detects high-risk tokens by analyzing price swings and liquidity fragility — flagging potential rug pulls and volatile behaviors.

### 🛰 OrbitalTrack — Transaction Anomaly Detector

```python
def orbital_track(tx_data):
    anomaly_threshold = 0.3
    pattern_score = (tx_data["amount"] * tx_data["price_change"]) / tx_data["total_volume"]

    if pattern_score > anomaly_threshold:
        return "⚠️ Alert: Anomalous Blockchain Activity"
    return "✅ Transaction Pattern Normal"
```
#### Detects unusual transaction patterns like flash-mint loops or coordinated bot behavior using adaptive anomaly learning.

### 🧠 CosmosGuard — Smart Contract Complexity Profiler

```python
def cosmos_guard(contract_data):
    complexity_factor = (contract_data["size"] * contract_data["execution_time"]) / 1000
    risk_level = complexity_factor * contract_data["transaction_frequency"]

    if risk_level > 2.5:
        return "⚠️ Alert: Complex or Risky Contract"
    return "✅ Contract is Stable"
```
#### Analyzes smart contract logic and behavioral traits. Flags contracts that mirror exploit-prone structures or high execution risks.

### ☄️ MeteorShield — Live Risk Pulse Monitor

```python
def meteor_shield(tx_data):
    change_rate = abs(tx_data["token_change_rate"] / tx_data["previous_rate"])
    threshold = 0.5

    if change_rate > threshold:
        return "⚠️ Threat Detected: Abnormal Activity"
    return "✅ Market Conditions Stable"
```
#### Monitors real-time token rate changes and movement velocity — alerts on flash dumps, sudden inflows, or suspicious whale action.

### ⏱ CelestialSync — Time Drift Validator

```python
import time

def celestial_sync(tx_data):
    allowed_drift_ms = 1000
    time_diff = abs(tx_data["timestamp"] - int(time.time() * 1000))

    if time_diff > allowed_drift_ms:
        return "⚠️ Alert: Time Desync Detected"
    return "✅ Timing Aligned"
```
#### Validates that blockchain timestamps align with real-world time. Helps detect oracle exploits, MEV windows, and injection lag.

### 🔗 How the AI Works as One System
#### AstrisGuard’s modules are not isolated — they work in unison through a multi-layered AI engine:
- Cross-module correlation: If multiple modules flag the same token or contract (e.g. StarGuard + CosmosGuard), an escalated threat protocol is triggered.
- Adaptive learning: Feedback from community validation (DAO votes, user reports) is used to adjust thresholds and reduce false positives.
- Behavioral fingerprinting: AstrisGuard builds unique profiles for tokens, contracts, and wallets — then compares them to a growing dataset of threats.

## 🛸 Closing Transmission

**AstrisGuard doesn’t sleep — it orbits**  
It maps intent, traces deception, and locks onto threats before they strike  
This is more than defense. It’s celestial vigilance — written in code
